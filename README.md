# Role-Based Ticket Management System

A modern full-stack Single Page Application (SPA) built using Angular and Node.js to demonstrate role-based authentication, user management, asynchronous API handling, and a premium glassmorphism UI design.

This project was developed as part of a Software Engineer Internship code challenge.

#  API Documentation

The Node.js backend serves several REST API endpoints. It includes a `delay` query parameter to simulate asynchronous processing.

- `POST /api/login`: Validates credentials and returns the user object.
- `GET /api/records`: Fetches records filtered by `userId` and `role`.
- `GET /api/users`: Returns all users (Requires `role=Admin`).
- `POST /api/users`: Creates a new user (Requires `role=Admin`).
- `PUT /api/users/:id`: Updates an existing user (Requires `role=Admin`).
- `DELETE /api/users/:id`: Deletes a user (Requires `role=Admin`).

#  Setup & Installation

You need two terminal windows to run this full-stack application locally.

### 1. Start the Backend API (Terminal 1)
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```
*Note: The backend runs on `http://localhost:3000` and uses `nodemon` for hot-reloading.*

### 2. Start the Frontend (Terminal 2)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
*Note: The Angular frontend runs on `http://localhost:4200`.*
